Hello there! This is a small image gallery that represent 3 things I like the most in my life: programming, travelling and cooking.

I really wanted to create a "complete" page for a website that could really exist.

This page could be a starting page for a portfolio website or just a small private photo gallery.

The page is made with:
1) HTML, 
2) CSS,
3) Bootstrap,
4) a little bit of jQuery and JS (but not personally coded)

The navbar menu collapses when the screen is small (tablet/iPad) and extra small (smartphone). 
For that feature I had to add two links to the jQuery and JS in the end. Although I didn't use JS or jQuery in this project personally, those links ensure the functionality of the navbar.

The page is also fully responsive and can be read comfortably from any screen.

I uploaded a photo gallery as well, since I cropped all the pictures to the same size in order for them to fit nicely.
All the pictures are taken from unsplash.com. According to their license anyone is free to use their photos for commercial and noncommercial purposes without asking permission.


Please let me know if I have made any mistakes or my code could be refactored in a more efficient way. Thanks in advance!
